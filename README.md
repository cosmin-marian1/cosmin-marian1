## Hi there 👋

I'm a 19-year-old engineering student and passionate developer with experience in creating interactive web and gaming applications. I enjoy working with React for building dynamic user interfaces and have skills in backend development using Node.js and MongoDB. My main interests are in UI/UX design, game development, and animations, where I can combine technical expertise with visual creativity.
